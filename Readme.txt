Hello....

My name is Varun Kaushik. In this project, I have wroked with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. 
I have merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.

In this project you will also see the Covid19 spread in each country is well. And at last, i have visulalised some graphs is well based on the updated dataset.

*****Note - This dataset is from 22nd January to 30th April.
